				<p>About sixty five million years ago lived Gary, a Triceratops, who arguably had the longest horns in Texas. In the twilight each evening, he patrolled his turf and routinely carried a grudge. In fact, whenever he walked anywhere, he aggressively swayed his shoulders. During one of his strolls just before bedtime, Gary attempted to walk off a very large salad that he had eaten for dinner (per usual), when suddenly from an extra-large bush a starved Tyrannosaurus rex stormed out and snatched at Gary's meaty tail, and then all of a sudden together they saw a blinding light while the land before time came to an awfully abrupt ending. But Gary, one of the last and best of the wondrous dinosaurs, did not die hungry.</p>
